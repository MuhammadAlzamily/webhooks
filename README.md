# Webhooks For Discord

**So these are funny webhooks i configured for my own server and i found them cool to be found in a server so i thought of sharing them with anyone who wants to use them**

---

**What are webhooks ?**
--

So webhooks are basically a way to automate - in this case - a feed to a certain channel in your server without the need to authenticate or having a bot account and there is a very helpful guide by discord you can find [here](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/) on how to use them in case you want very customized webhooks output


These webhooks - so far - include :

1. Random stuff Donald Trump thinks of or said before and they're pretty dumb lmfao

2. Random Chuck Norris facts / jokes just to add a little fun to the server

---

**Why webhooks?**
--

Like i mentioned above webhooks - in my opinion - are prefered over bots because they're more customizable as you can add a different icon and a display name for each webhook and they don't need any authentication with discord unlike bots and they're much easier to make with very friendly formatting if you check the [guide](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/)

**How to use them?**
--

It's pretty simple just follow these steps below

1. Server settings > integrations > create webhook

2. Name your webhook - if you want, in this case the name is determined within the script - 

3. Choose the channel you want your webhook to output to 

4. Copy the generated webhook token 

5. Replace the token in this script with the link from step 4

6. Enjoy them :D

*You can create multiple webhooks btw for multiple channels if you want ofc*

I'll be adding more to these webhooks and updating the repo if i find anything cool or funny 

*Since the cool kids do this on github, under MIT license*
